# cgamev1.1
for this version i went with a lighter background and toned down the borders a little bit.
i also added the :hover property to the responses to make it a little more reactive.
additionally i added a header that is very easily able to be added to other pages with
buttons like Home which takes you home... and How To Play that gives you a quick tutorial
so it's not sitting in the landing page with the start button.
i also added start over and game over buttons. the start over brings you straight to the
beginning and the game over takes you home so there's no need for the header/nav bar.
in the future i'm planning on adding an about us column to the navbar with a page
containing more information about me, julian naranjo ramos.
i'd also like to add a go back button so you can compare your choice with another one
as well as more animations. i used classes in different ways and something i just learned:
display: inline; and how to use the box model.
